# Pathogen
Pathogen is a browser-based application that simulates a genetic algorithm finding an optimal path through a maze.
The user starts by generating a maze via various options: random, preset, or user-drawn. 
A population of agents is spawned into the mazed and tasked with finding the optimal path out. They acomplish this by moving through the maze based on a fitnes function that gets refined over time. This refinement process is an evolutionary phase–consisting of selection, mating, crossover, and mutation–that encourages those agnets with better fitness to produce the majority of the next generation. Over time, a subsequent population will converge to the optimal path.
